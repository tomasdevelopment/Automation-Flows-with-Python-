Welcome to My Python AWS Portfolio
Introduction
Hello and welcome to my Python AWS portfolio! This project showcases my skills in cloud computing, specifically focusing on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Python programming. Here, you'll find a collection of projects and scripts that demonstrate how to leverage AWS services to build scalable, efficient, and robust cloud solutions.
Project Overview
In this portfolio, we're exploring the integration of various AWS services to create a comprehensive cloud-based system. Our main focus is on three core AWS services:

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
AWS Lambda
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

What We're Doing
Our project aims to demonstrate how these services can work together to create a powerful, serverless data processing pipeline. Here's a high-level overview of what we're building:

Data Storage with S3: We use Amazon S3 as our primary data storage solution. S3 provides a scalable and durable platform for storing and retrieving any amount of data.
Serverless Processing with Lambda: AWS Lambda functions are used to process data stored in S3. These functions are triggered automatically when new data is uploaded to S3, allowing for real-time data processing without the need to manage servers.
Compute and Analysis with EC2: For more complex computations or long-running processes that don't fit within Lambda's execution limits, we utilize Amazon EC2 instances. These virtual servers in the cloud provide the computational power needed for intensive data analysis tasks.
