ðŸš€ Contributing to Open Source with NASA Rover Data! ðŸš€

In a recent project, I leveraged the NASA Rovers open-source API to implement an ETL process. Here's a snapshot of the technical setup:

Data Retrieval & Transformation: Pulled data using the NASA API, transformed it with pandas, and stored it in an S3 bucket.
Scheduling & Access: Set up a daily data refresh with a cron job and enabled on-demand access via an API Gateway.
Security & Permissions: Configured IAM roles to grant Lambda functions S3 full control and used environment variables to manage the NASA API keys securely.
Monitoring: Utilized CloudWatch to monitor the ETL process, which had a timeout of 5 minutes. The CloudWatch report showed:
Request ID: 259c5cc6-375b-400d-9904-b19526daeb1d
Duration: 15,884.95 ms
Billed Duration: 15,885 ms
Memory Size: 128 MB
Max Memory Used: 124 MB
Init Duration: 2,221.76 ms
This project demonstrates how AWS serverless solutions simplify data aggregation and processing. I did it a 5-minute timeout (out of a 15-minute limit) but you could reduce it to try to control costs,
effective organization and monitoring allow for efficient data handling and transformation. ðŸŒŒðŸ’¡

Check out the mission costs for the Mars rovers:

Mars Science Lab (MLS): $2.9 billion
Mars Exploration Project (MEP): $1.2 billion
